# Yet Another Book on AI!
I have been working mostly with TensorFlow and Keras so far, and decided to explore another AI framework, namely PyTorch. To learn about it, I started to read <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/>

Note that the book (and associated notebooks) is available at <https://course.fast.ai/>

Here are my first thoughts & comments about this book.

## The authors
The two authors, Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, have very different backgrounds.
* Jeremy has no formal technical education, but developed a strong AI hands-on experience working on a lot of projects (as a consultant, then running his own company). 
* Sylvain has a very solid formal mathematical and technical background, with less experience on software coding & machine learning.
These different backgrounds seem appealing for a book on AI, where both software & math need to be combined. Hopefully, the rest of the book will demonstrate that, indeed, the authors are able to clarify concepts to readers with missing backgrounds.

## Deep learning is for everyone
Interestingly, the authors kick off their book by busting some myths - one of them being that deep learning requires lots of data to work. They mentioned that one could achieve great results w/ less than 50 items of data. This is somewhat aligned with Fran√ßois Chollet's comments in his book <https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python>, where there is a section highlighting the relevance of deep learning for small-data problems.
