# Yet Another Book on AI!
I have been working mostly with TensorFlow and Keras so far, and decided to explore another AI framework, namely PyTorch. To learn about it, I started to read <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/>

Note that the book (and associated notebooks) is available at <https://course.fast.ai/>

Here are my first thoughts & comments about this book.
